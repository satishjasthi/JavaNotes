java is highly portable language, it can be written in a single machine
and run in multiple machine which are operating in different platforms.

The way Java works is
-Create a source code
-Pass source code to Compiler which converts it into Java byte code
-Now this Java byte code can be run in any machine which uses Java and
bytecode is platform independent

Whenever you run .java source code using javac command(javac is compiler name)
it generates a bytecode file like .class

Structure of any Java program:
Source file
    class
        Method
          statement
        Method
          statement
          .
          .
          .
Every Java machine must have atleast one class and one main method
every class in application need not have a main method overall atleast
one main method must be there.

Every program in java is a class,once you compile the source code it
creates a .class file and every time when we run the program we are
actually run .class or java bytecode file.

javac - is to compile the code
ex: javac Hello.java

java - is to run the code
ex: java Hello

// - for comments

Boolean and integer are not compatible in java.
ex: int q = 5
while (q){

}
This doesn't work in java, for this to work q must be a boolean or a
boolean condition like q == 5

println : prints each item in a new line
print: prints in a same line
