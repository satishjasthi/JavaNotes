java is highly portable language, it can be written in a single machine
and run in multiple machine which are operating in different platforms.

The way Java works is
-Create a source code
-Pass source code to Compiler which converts it into Java byte code
-Now this Java byte code can be run in any machine which uses Java and
bytecode is platform independent

Whenever you run .java source code using javac command(javac is compiler name)
it generates a bytecode file like .class

Structure of any Java program:
Source file
    class
        Method
          statement
        Method
          statement
          .
          .
          .
Every Java machine must have atleast one class and one main method
every class in application need not have a main method overall atleast
one main method must be there.
